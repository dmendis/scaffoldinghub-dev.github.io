Over the 2022 december holiday period I decided to learn some more about mason and dynamic code generation with build_runner. These tools seemed like a great way to experiment with how to solve a challenge I am facing as a weekend warrior developer. So much boiler plate!

For most of 2022 I have been exploring how to do meaningful test-driven development (TDD) and have progressed nicely, but find I can't get that far on a Saturday/Sunday and need to recover ground. 

As a developer dating back to cold fusion and grails - I sensed there was an opportunity to bootstrap a lot of this work and also help others learn how to unit test CRUD (create, read, update and delete) actions in a a simple application. 

The result?

1. [scaffolding, scaffolding_test, scaffolding_home, scaffolding_home_test](https://github.com/mason_bricks)
1. [scaffolding package](https://pub.dev/packages/scaffolding)

I now have 4 mason bricks and my first pub.dev dart/flutter package and a tonne of documentation to hopefully keep this moving and encourage other to contribute or learn from this work. 

As I return to my exec role during the week, I also hope to remind my team that we are always *makers* :)
