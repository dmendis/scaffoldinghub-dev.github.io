            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the 2022 december holiday period I decided to learn some more about mason and dynamic code generation with build_runner. These tools seemed like a great way to experiment with how to solve a challenge I am facing as a weekend warrior developer. So much boiler plate!</p><p>For most of 2022 I have been exploring how to do meaningful test-driven development (TDD) and have progressed nicely, but find I can't get that far on a Saturday/Sunday and need to recover ground. </p><p>As a developer dating back to cold fusion and grails - I sensed there was an opportunity to bootstrap a lot of this work and also help others learn how to unit test CRUD (create, read, update and delete) actions in a a simple application. </p><p>The result?</p><ol><li><a href="https://github.com/mason_bricks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scaffolding, scaffolding_test, scaffolding_home, scaffolding_home_test</a></li><li><a href="https://pub.dev/packages/scaffolding" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scaffolding package</a></li></ol><table><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img loading="lazy" src="img/package.png" width="230" class="img_ev3q"></td><td><img loading="lazy" src="img/bricks.png" width="230" class="img_ev3q"></td><td><img loading="lazy" src="img/home_2feature_scaffold.png" width="230" class="img_ev3q"></td></tr><tr><td><img loading="lazy" src="img/feature1.png" width="230" class="img_ev3q"></td><td><img loading="lazy" src="img/feature2.png" width="230" class="img_ev3q"></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>I now have 4 mason bricks and my first pub.dev dart/flutter package and a tonne of documentation to hopefully keep this moving and encourage other to contribute or learn from this work. </p><p>As I return to my exec role during the week, I also hope to remind my team that we are always <em>makers</em> :)</p>]]></content:encoded>
