These tools seemed like a great way to experiment with how to solve a challenge I am facing as a weekend warrior developer. So much boiler plate!\\n\\nFor most of 2022 I have been exploring how to do meaningful test-driven development (TDD) and have progressed nicely, but find I can\'t get that far on a Saturday/Sunday and need to recover ground. \\n\\nAs a developer dating back to cold fusion and grails - I sensed there was an opportunity to bootstrap a lot of this work and also help others learn how to unit test CRUD (create, read, update and delete) actions in a a simple application. \\n\\nThe result?\\n\\n1.
