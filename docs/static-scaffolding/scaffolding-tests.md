# Scaffolding Tests ðŸ§ª

One of the most interesting and time-saving elements of scaffolding is generating the unit tests to achive 100% coverage. This provide a great set of *boiler plate* examples to borrow from as you evolve your application away from the initial scaffold. 

[scaffolding_test](https://github.com/sjhorn/mason_bricks/scaffolding_test) is a option mason brick that is called when the option `--generate-tests` is true. 

To allow these unit test to work with our flutter project we have 2 exra dependencies - `bloc_test` and `mocktail`. Add those to the project as follows:

```sh
flutter pub add mocktail bloc_test --dev
```

To continue with the previous example, lets add unit tests and use the command parameters to do this. 

```sh
mason make scaffolding --package static_scaffolding_sample --feature feature1 \
    --properties "String firstname=Your first name, String lastname=Your suranme, bool registered=false" \
    --generate-tests true --generate-home true

```

Running this you will see a similar output to the following:

```sh
You have the following properties: [{name: firstname, type: String, defaultValue: 'Your first name', emptyValue: '', testValue: 'testString'}, {name: lastname, type: String, defaultValue: 'Your suranme', emptyValue: '', testValue: 'testString'}, {name: registered, type: bool, defaultValue: false, emptyValue: false, testValue: true}]

Note the new files now created under `test/`. Given we also specified to generate the home scaffold we also go the unit test for this.

The full list of addtional files are:
```
test/
â”œâ”€ scaffold_app_test.dart
â””â”€ features/
   â””â”€ feature1/
      â”œâ”€ data/
      â”‚  â”œâ”€ feature1_model_test.dart
      â”‚  â””â”€ feature1_repository_impl_test.dart

```

To show our tests in action we can run them and generate the coverage report as follows:

```sh
flutter test --coverage && genhtml -p ./lib -o coverage coverage/lcov.info && open coverage/index.html
```


:::info Note this depends on `lcov` 

On mac this is as simple as `brew install lcov` if you have install [homebrew](https://brew.sh)
:::


The result of running this command is

```sh
00:10 +62: All tests passed!

Congratulations ðŸ¥³ 421 lines and 100% coverage. You can edit these files to learn more about how they are unit tested and as you change the scaffold you are in a good place to consider Test Driven Development (TDD) with some great examples.
