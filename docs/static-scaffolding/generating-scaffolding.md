# Generating Scaffolding ðŸš€

The simplest scaffolding options generate a create, read, update and delete (CRUD) application and the home view. 

Let's do that from the command line using the prompts:

```sh
mason make scaffolding
? What is the package name of your flutter project? (scaffolding_sample) scaffolding_sample
? What is your feature name (eg. Todo, DiaryProject, contact) ? (feature1) feature1
? Enter property list in the following format "String firstname=Your first name, String lastname=Your suranme, bool registered=false" ? String firstname=Your first name, String lastname=Your suranme, bool registered=false
? Do you want unit tests generated? n
? Do you want to generate the home page / main function ? (y/N) y
```

This will then run scaffolding and list the files:

```sh
You have the following properties: [{name: firstname, type: String, defaultValue: 'Your first name', emptyValue: '', testValue: 'testString'}, {name: lastname, type: String, defaultValue: 'Your suranme', emptyValue: '', testValue: 'testString'}, {name: registered, type: bool, defaultValue: false, emptyValue: false, testValue: true}]

 ```

 You now have a scaffolded application ðŸŽ‰ - if you select the main.dart file you will be able to run the file and see screen similar to the ones below after you create a new contact.

![Feature Scaffoling](/img/feature1_scaffold.png)

The file structure is as follows:
```
lib/
â”œâ”€ main.dart
â”œâ”€ scaffold_app.dart
â”œâ”€ features/
â”‚  â””â”€ feature1/
â”‚     â”œâ”€ data/
â”‚     â”‚  â”œâ”€ feature1_model.dart

Ok let's learn about more options.
