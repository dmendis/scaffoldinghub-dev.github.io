# Limitations ‚ùå

1. The types are limited to String, bool, int and double - this will be expanded to Map and List types in future.
1. The Update views use Strings for all variables rather than suitable form widgets - this will be address in a future version.
1. The Read view uses String to represent types that may make more sense as other widgets - this will be changed in a future version. 
1. Grails and Rails scaffolding offer my sophisticated contraints / validation - this will be added in future versions. 
1. The static scaffolding brick does not search for existing domain classes like the dynamic scaffolding does, this will be merged in future.
